The toolkit was built for engineers and contributors at Foretag and heavily focused on our technology stack - found on [Stackshare](https://stackshare.io/foretag/foretag), following updates in parallel. Its objective is to provide a unified development experience, limiting complexity and improving accessibility. You can find all the bells and whistles: theme, icons, extensions, language, snippets, and more right out of the box.


We pride ourselves on building world-class software, and our developer experience is quintessential in helping us achieve this. So, we've taken feedback from our engineers and the wider community to build a collection of tools to bring a native IDE experience to VSCode and reduce dependence on third-party tooling. Updates are regular, so feel free to create a discussion with your idea if you'd like to improve the experience further.
