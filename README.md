# Engineering at Foretag

> ðŸª§ This repository contains multiple packages that form our engineering toolchain built for internal and public use as part of our Engineering focus.

World-class projects need first-class developer experience. We work with our engineers and outside contributors to create tooling - that is optimal for a seamless experience across our toolchain. Developed from the ground up to reduce boilerplate and increase consistency to help keep your head in the game.

Our ethos inspires transparency and innovation, and our engineering guide is no exception. Here you can find all the resources: guides, IDE extensions, shareable configs, and wikis to help you work across any of our projects.

**Why?**

We strive for a consistent, easy-to-use environment for all our engineers and contributors to minimize friction, scale faster and improve the quality of our projects. If you have ideas to improve this experience, open an issue and write away - we're all ears.
